This is a program that permits to read non linear books (gamebooks). It courrently has one short original book for testing. 
At the moment it's translated in 3 languages (English, Esperanto and Italian).

When it's ready for an alfa version I will make a page on itch.io for a simpler downloading

It's my first serious project so feel free to criticize
